Learning Guide
==============

## Introduction
### Welcome to Jeremy's Guide to Learning.

I want to help everyone with learning by creating a guide that helps one learn about how to learn while giving real life examples. I'll be learning markdown language, unix commands, and git to solidify my understanding of these tools, and in turn will go through my process of how to learn.

## An Overview of the [Learning Project](learning)

### [Learning Theory](learning/theory.md)

I've done lots of reading on learning and I thought this would be a great place to combine all of the knowledge I have on it and update it regularly instead of doing a blog posts. Blog posts are great, but most of my writing is close to stream of consciousness. One of the things I'm practicing is editing and cutting down time for my feedback loops. I'll open up issues on Github here so people can make comments and critique my work as I start to fill out this repository. This will be a fun way for me to really see what I can improve on.

### [Learning Practice](learning/practice.md) (i.e. Learn by Doing)

I am a Cal Poly Alumni ('12 BMED) and the big motto for the school is to "Learn by Doing". That means we don't just learn the theory behind how to do our field of practice, we actually go out and do it. Lots of learning happens more when we practice.

#### Applications:

##### [Markdown](markdown)
##### [Unix Commands](unix)
##### [Git](git)

### Learn by Teaching

As an educator, the best way I can engage my students is when we do role reversals. I let the student teach me as much as they can and we work off of each other trying to get to a common goal: the compentency of the student learning a particular concept. It's really useful for subjects in math and science because I can gauge the gaps in a students knowledge. It also allows the student to make more connections and learn more synthetically instead of rote memorization.

### [Learning Case Studies](learning/studies.md)

Over time, I'll also include a bunch of case studies for learning as applications of the theory. It helps solidify some of the concepts by telling stories which people can relate much more easily to. I'm not entirely sure if this will be its own separate folder or just interwoven into everything, but none-the-less this is an integral part of this guide.

## Project To-do List

The to-do list is a list of items that I have completed or am currently working on. If there are any issues with this guide, please create an issue and I will add it to the to-do list.
