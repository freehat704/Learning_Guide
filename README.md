Learning Guide
==============

## Welcome to Jeremy's Guide to Learning.

#### I want to help everyone with learning by creating a guide that helps one learn about how to learn while giving real life examples. I'll be learning markdown language, unix commands, and git to solidify my understanding of these tools, and in turn will go through my process of how to learn.

### [Markdown Language](markdown)
### [Unix Commands](unix)
### [Git](git)
