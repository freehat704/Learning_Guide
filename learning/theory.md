## Learning Difficulties

#### Psychological Breaks

I backed David Lang's book called "Zero to Maker"* on Kickstater and in the last update he had for the project, he included an omission to his book that he thinks should be added. The title of the post is called "[The Audacity of Learning](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1818704744/zero-to-maker-a-re-skilling-guide-for-new-makers/posts/751387?at=BAh7CDoMcG9zdF9pZGkDG3cLSSIIdWlkBjoGRVRpAvzrSSILZXhwaXJ5BjsGVEkiGDIwMTQtMDMtMTggMDE6MTE6NDYGOwZU--aaaed9c34a40b4576b15b306be39aeb1aee46a35&ref=backer_project_update)" which talks about his experiences of dealing with the struggles of learning new skills.

>I quickly moved through the parts of my story that were hard - the depression, the doubting, the insecurity - because I didn't wish that for anyone else. Probably more honestly, though, I just didn't know how to talk about those moments. I still don't. They're intensely personal. And embarrassing. I know that people are facing far bigger issues and challenges: illness, grief, loss. Those are real problems. Worrying about my lack of creative ability hardly seemed like reason to complain.

In other words: just terrible.

## The Theory of Experts

### Research from [Dr. K. Ander's Ericsson](http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson.dp.html)

One of the most publicized studies is Dr. Ericsson's study on chess masters. Malcolm Gladwell writes about it in his book "Outliers" and publicizes the 10,000 hour rule.
