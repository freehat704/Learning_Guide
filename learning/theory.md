Learning Theory

[Back To The Learning Guide Home Page](../README.md)

This section talks about studies in learning, applications of these studies, self studies, and some of my opinion mixed in. I've done some work in technical writing, but I didn't want this to sound dry, so I've sprinkled in some of my own opinion and added stories where they were needed. Some of my writing is from years ago, and I'm just going back and editing it now. It's all just a work in progress and I'm slowly editing this page, so add issues if you see them. Disclaimer: I'm not a scientist, although I've done a few years of academic research, so I generally know what I'm looking at when I'm reading an academic journal.

## On Beginning

Beginning something new can be terrifying. I have a whole portion of the psychological effects later on. Here's a spoken word speech on beginning:

> Don’t call it a comb-back; I’ll have hair for years.

> I’m scared.

> I’m scared that my abilities are gone.

> I’m scared that I’m going to fuck this up.

> And I’m scared of you.

> I don’t want to start, but I will.This is an invocation for anyone who hasn’t begun, who’s stuck in a terrible place between zero and one.

> Let me realize that my past failures at follow-through are no indication of my future performance.

> They’re just healthy little fires that are going to warm up my ass.

> If my FILDI (fuck it let’s do it) is strong let me keep him in a velvet box until I really, really need him.

> If my FILDI is weak let me feed him oranges and not let him gorge himself on ego and arrogance.Let me not hit up my Facebook like it’s a crack pipe

> Keep the browser closed.

> If I catch myself wearing a too-too (too fat, too late, too old) let me shake it off like a donkey would shake off something it doesn’t like.

> And when I get that feeling in my stomach — you know the feeling when all of a sudden you get a ball of energy and it shoots down into your legs and up into your arms and tells you to get up and stand up and go to the refrigerator and get a cheese sandwich — that’s my cheese monster talking.

> And my cheese monster will never be satisfied by cheddar, only the cheese of accomplishment.

> Let me think about the people who I care about the most, and how when they fail or disappoint me… I still love them, I still give them chances, and I still see the best in them.  

> Let me extend that generosity to myself.

> Let me find and use metaphors to help me understand the world around me and give me the strength to get rid of them when it’s apparent they no longer work.

> Let me thank the parts of me that I don’t understand or are outside of my rational control like my creativity and my courage.

> And let me remember that my courage is a wild dog.

> It won’t just come when I call it, I have to chase it down and hold on as tight as I can. Let me not be so vain to think that I’m the sole author of my victories and a victim of my defeats.

> Let me remember that the unintended meaning that people project onto what I do is neither my fault or something I can take credit for.

> Perfectionism may look good in his shiny shoes but he’s a little bit of an asshole and no one invites him to their pool parties.

> Let me remember that the impact of criticism is often not the intent of the critic, but when the intent is evil, that’s what the block button’s for.

> And when I eat my critique, let me be able to separate out the good advice from the bitter herbs.

> (There are few people who won’t be disarmed by a genuine smile

> A big impact on a few can be worth more than a small impact)

> Let me not think of my work only as a stepping stone to something else, and if it is, let me become fascinated with the shape of the stone.
> Let me take the idea that has gotten me this far and put it to bed.

> What I am about to do will not be that, but it will be something.There is no need to sharpen my pencils anymore.  
> My pencils are sharp enough.  

> Even the dull ones will make a mark.

> Warts and all.

> Let’s start this shit up.

> And God let me enjoy this.  Life isn’t just a sequence of waiting for things to be done.

> - [Ze Frank, "An Invocation For Beginning", "A Show", Youtube, 2012](http://ashow.zefrank.com/episodes/1)

[![Ze Frank A Show Episode 1](http://img.youtube.com/vi/RYlCVwxoL_g/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYlCVwxoL_g)

And here's another quote with fewer words:

> Sucking at something is the first step to kinda not sucking at something
> - Jake the dog, "Adventure Time" tv show, Cartoon network, 2013

> Stop waiting for something to happen or for someone to give you permission to do things.

> - Kate Kendall (but probably attributed by Seth Godin)

## Intro to meta-learning

I may have mentioned before that there are different ways that we learn, and how it takes more than just thinking about what we want to learn. Mental performance is highly dependent on how much you stop thinking about how to learn, for example. When reached at a certain peak of complexity of a task matched with a fair amount of skill, you may reach a state called flow. So what is learning? It’s a form of challenging yourself, or a collective, to form something new, whether it is a mindset, a goal, or a skill. Learning has its roots in nature, where adaptability is one form of survival. Learning happens everywhere and at anytime, whether we would like to or not. New neural pathways are built from learning something, whether it is new ideas, movements in our body, or people that we frequently see. Evolution is nature’s way of learning, albeit very slowly. Now we understand the semantics of learning, how do we go about doing it?

There are two distinct ways of learning and each do not have a binary switch of being bad or good; there is passive and active learning. Passive learning is a form of interesting learning if you utilize it the right way. I may have mentioned before about mental performance and letting the right side of the mind do more of the heavy lifting when it comes to being the best at athletic sports. The same concept is used for musicians, masseurs, chefs, and many others for their art and craft. It takes that tactile touch and other senses to really bring together something that cannot just be forged by nature. For example, a tennis swing can be taught through oral procedure, but the mind isn’t going to implement it correctly. Mentally, you think, oh, I have to swing back first, then I’ve got to hit at the right point of the racket and that point of contact should be 90 degrees relative to the base line, and I’ve got to follow through when releasing the ball’s point of contact. With that much thinking, you’ll never be able to pull it off correctly. That’s when we rely on that other side of our brain, i.e. that “heavy lifting” we mentioned earlier. This type of learning is a form of kinesthetic learning, which can be useful for teaching athletes other subjects because they may prefer to learn in movement. Active learning, which is learning with intensive thinking about a certain subject, primarily utilizes the left side of the brain, but an experienced learner will actually know how to use both. Holistic learning is probably one of the best ways to learn many subjects, but not always, e.g. law. It’s the opposite of compartmentalized learning, the act of making distinction one subject to another subject, never letting them interacts with each other; for example, a teenager may stop thinking math is useful for anything and just learns it just for the practicality of passing their math class and forget it after he or she exits the classroom. Holistic learning stems from the fact that these concepts and ideas interact with one another, which is why you might be able to explain one concept if you knew a bunch about an associated subject. For example, if we know things about chemical formulas and properties, we could explain why the volume of gas is less in the morning versus in the afternoon. We may not know the complete fine details, but we can ascertain to why it is because of the foundations we created.

Foundations are created by the building blocks that make up complex components, as we see with the curriculum of engineering degrees. Mathematics follows this principle quite nicely. But like the order of the universe, we cannot just learn step by step of how to be a designer in a classroom. We can talk about these subjects, but just as we talked about in the procedure of a tennis swing, it takes some bit of action to learn. With design work of any type, be it software or hardware, we can see that having projects to work with will actually increase our knowledge of these big building block ideas. Learning actively all of the time is crucial in success while working. When I hear friends say that they stopped learning after my last college or high school class, I just want to slap them in the face and tell them that you never stop learning. I don’t care if you’re too young or too old, too fragile or too shy, the world has infinite possibilities to learn just about anything. This steps on one of the interesting things about the process of learning: learning progression of skills.

If there was perfection, we wouldn’t need to exist. Human flaw and error is why learning exists in the first place, and that’s great because to really hone our craft at doing anything we want, there is an innate process of learning. Even if you’re the top expert in a field, you have something to learn. I watched a movie about the best sushi chef in the world, and his goal everyday is to top the sushi he made all of the previous times he has made sushi. The craft in that is not just the sushi, but the presentation, the audience, and the management of your workers who make it possible even to make the sushi. Learning is strange in that even when you’ve mastered all of the building blocks, you can go back and learn more about the complexities of that topic. If we talk about math, learning about partial differentials only opens up a world of possibility (Douglas Adams would probably say improbability) with applications in sound, heat, electrodynamics, fluid flow, etc. The human limit is when we quit doing that, learn the mindset of saying we don’t learn anymore, and watch a mindless TV show that will waste time and make us learn about the story of that TV show.

## Children and Studying

### Intro to Child Development

### The Blank Mind

Steven Pinker has written a book on how much we know when we're born called "The Blank Slate". This gets us into the discussion on nature vs. nurture. In terms of learning, how much of ourselves is determined by our genetic make-up and how much of it is due to our own practice and doing (external stimuli)? It turns out that very little in skill is innate. For example, we may be more predisposed to throwing 3-pointers in basketball better because of our height, but it's not the only factor. It turns out almost all of our skills can be learned.

Mastery is when you have grasp and control of a [skill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery) or understand a sector of knowledge and can recall it and use it when needed at will. There's a few ways of defining how we see mastery, and I think the best way has been drawn up by [a few researchers](http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment/dp/0452267560/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1364445693&sr=1-2&keywords=mastery) who [devote a lot of time](http://gettingstronger.org/2010/03/george-leonards-mastery/) looking at [outliers](http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1364445673&sr=8-1&keywords=outliers). I'll reference a lot of this book, [Mastery](http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Robert-Greene/dp/0670024961/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1364445693&sr=1-1&keywords=mastery) by Robert Greene.

One way of looking at it is like this graph where first you are learning lots and lots, and then you reach what is referred here as a slump. We call this the initial growth "hypergrowth." During this period, you realize that you're learning as much as you can about the subject, for example learning Spanish. Initially, you learn a few words and phrases that you can piece together for a short conversation. However, when you get to longer conversations, you get stuck and try to use words that are unfamiliar to you are aren't practiced enough, as well as more complex ideas like the subjective tense. In these cases, you've reached a slump, and you realize that you're not fluent in the language, so your skill seems to diminish due to the effects of under-confidence bias. But slowly you're skill curve rises back up, and flattens out for a bit. This is called "the plateau" in which you try really hard to pound it in your brain, but as we understand from research, rote memorization can only work so quickly due to [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory)(a human limitation where the brain can only hold 7 +/- 2 chunks of information at any given time).

But don't be alarmed, there's an epiphany moment when you realize how it all fits. That's the feeling after weeks of practice paying off, and you reach a new understanding of the topic, like understanding when to use the subjective tense in Spanish and how to instantly conjugate the verb. However, there may be more of those moments of slumps where you're holes of knowledge slowly get filled in. And the process is always slow, as shown with the second slump in the graph. But you get it eventually. Finally, after all the problems with the process of learning, you reach a mastery at your skill or knowledge bank.

There's an eponymous law called [Pareto's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) that says that 80% of the output is created by 20% of the work. That's very true with skill acquisition where it seems easy the first 80% to 90% of the way, but to really acquire that last 10% of a skill, it takes upwards of 50%+ of the work to get there. A lot of that frustration seems to stem from not understanding something and still trying to pursue it. It's the anxiety feeling we get, and it falls out of our optimal point of working, which is called [flow](http://goo.gl/lbQ679). But sometimes, that's what it takes to really get there. The idea of doing something is always a lot easier to get done than the actual process of making that idea a reality.

[Apprenticeships](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2012/11/12/the-magic-of-apprenticeship-a-how-to-guide/) used to be the way of learning the essential skills of how to be a master at any field. You'd be passed down to a mentor who can show you these skills, for example blacksmithing, and how the art and craft of creating a tool involves precision and hand-eye coordination. There's the foundational steps to creating any tool that is taught by these mentors before one understands how any tool can be manufactured. Cal Newport's book of [Becoming a High School Superstar](http://www.amazon.com/How-High-School-Superstar-Revolutionary/dp/0767932587) talks of finding a mentor or someone who is willing to show a young person the ropes of their field.You've read this book before, and the author notes how to come about these people, how to get involved, and how to utilize the skills that you've learned towards the college application.

Why am I talking about all of this stuff anyways and how does it apply to you? Well, first off, it's the foundational steps in learning anything. You start to realize your potential in learning a topic of your choice, and if you fall out of interest with it, it doesn't mean the end all be all because hundreds if not thousands have also been though the struggle where only a few make it.When searching to acquire skills to make you more presentable for college recruiters, you must understand how hard it is to grasp something as hard as whatever you want to attain. Also, college is a way to further pursuits you have rather than to blindly follow what other are doing because it's the 'hot' thing to do. Really focus on what you like and know there's an uphill battle wherever that takes you. 

There are six stages to mastery:

1. Discover your calling: the life's task
2. Submit to reality: the ideal apprenticeship
3. Absorb the master's power: the mentor dynamic
4. See people as they are: social intelligence
5. Awaken the dimensional mind: the creative-active
6. Fuse the intuitive with the rational: mastery

Another thing in the book that goes in more detail is the second stage above: apprenticeship.

[Apprenticeship steps](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2012/12/05/gaining-mastery-the-three-vital-steps-of-the-apprenticeship-phase/):

1. Step One: Deep Observation—The Passive Mode
2. Step Two: Skills Acquisition—The Practice Mode
3. Step Three: Experimentation—The Active Mode

I'm giving you an overview of information because it seems important to know that you're on the first two steps of getting to mastery in your life's goals and that you really shouldn't fret of how little experience you have because every little thing you do counts. Except if you don't do anything with your time, in which case you may really need to focus on what's actually important to you. I'm also talking about apprenticeships because I don't think you're getting the right idea of what to really look out for. Community service things are great, but they're not what most college recruiters are looking for in a potential student. Every potential student worthy of looking at already has this under their belt. You're looking to stand out, and to do that, you just have to start doing things that no one else really is doing, which is really making the best out of what you actually want to learn. If it's fashion marketing, really pursue that by talking to those people in the field and have a grasp of what that profession means. If it's stem cell research, really go out of your way and email professors at local universities to see what type of research is out there and see how you can get involved or at least watch over the process of doing that type of research. It really starts with you expressing your voice to others with your intentions.

T[his blog post](http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2013/03/15/network-or-skills/) is a case in point of networking versus skills. The summary of the post is that you need both, and depending on who you are, you'll need more of one side versus another by using [marginal utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility) as a judgment call. This means that whatever gives you the greatest payoff is where you should put yourself. Right now, you're not marketable with the skills you have today, so really work on that. If it's a good work ethic you have to build, I would say start there. If it's really understanding how to draw or draft something, start there. There's an infinite amount of starting points of where to go with this. If you want more networking, start asking people in the field what your interest is in the field. Give me a draft of whoever you want to talk with, and then we'll talk to them in a professional manner. Really market yourself if marketing is the thing you want to pursue. Hell, even look at the college courses like I talked about last week and really immerse yourself in the technical jargon and principles of the profession you're trying to pursue. As someone said once, fake it until you make it.

Malcolm Gladwell points out in his book “Outliers” that while most people are successful for hard work and complimentary factors, people like more of the natural talent story. One’s ability to perform actions, whether mental or physical, is determined by so many environmental, or external, factors that aid or suppress it.

The science behind cramming takes a look at how memory works. I've talked long and hard about this topic before, but I never really made this explanation easy. I still will probably fail, but not as hard, as explaining how we learn.

##### Information Overload
I've read way too much this year, and I haven't given it enough time to really sink in, so I know too many trivial points, not enough tangible topics to boost my skill set in anything. What's the phrase now, "jack of all trades, master of none?" But I think that's the point; I'm trying to expose myself to things that I would normally just put off or otherwise wouldn't pursue. I don't think I've spent enough time re-analyzing the underlying themes of the things that I'm exposed to, so it's time to take that step back and look around.

### The Science of Habits

#### Unlearning

As easy as it is to learn things, it's a lot harder to unlearn things. This can be the short, snap judgment responses we have when stimulated by a certain response, or an ingrained belief in something, like deep rooted hatred towards the trans* community. I'm just fascinated by this topic almost more than the topic on learning because it's the root of breaking addictions, how to stop falling in the same traps, figuring out how to stop working that inner game mindset, and so much more that we're burdened with everyday.

To make this letter different, I thought I would tell you a personal story instead. During college, one of the things I set a goal for myself was to be a better person and stop thinking like I used to think, especially those downward spirals of regret and misery. One of the things I thought I wouldn't fall trap to was feel worthless and do nothing for an entire day. The way I would combat this in college was to overload myself with work so I would never feel that way. But after burnout, there were times where I wanted to do that. And then the downward spiral hits where I feel worthless, desperate, and slightly insane.

It wasn't until later when I realized what bothered me more wasn't that I wasn't doing anything, but that I had this worthless talk inside of me. I had to recognize that this was happening and talk to it, or just let it happen. Then I would move on, unfazed by it and do some work or give myself permission to relax. There weren't specific instances where this changed, it was the multitudes of doing that same exercise every time that it happened that changed me. Your neuro-pathways remember a certain way of going through similar experiences after you've created those pathways in your mind. When I talked about "Your Brain on Porn" two years ago, I talked about how new neruo-pathways are created to fill that void in sexual response, and it's making people less sensitive to pornographic content as well as subjecting themselves to a rather crude belief of what sex is in our society. Also, it could lead to health issues later in life.

## Learning Difficulties

### Psychological

#### Perfectionism

Perfection doesn't exist, but we can create a space for us to be happy never-the-less. We could do so passively, blindly going about life, not really paying attention to what means to us most. Or we can be active, really honing in on dealing with the tough situations and breaking bad habits. And being active actually takes work, not just relying on heuristics to go about our day. Effort really paves the way between this happiness and depression cycle. Some may tell you they choose to be happy. I say, we choose to be happy if we choose to make the effort to set the right conditions for ourselves. And the right conditions depend on yourself, exploring your mind and finding the right amount of activity that’s challenging and stimulating. And it doesn’t end.

I write because it stimulates me enough. And to know that at least one person will read this is reward enough to make me happy. Because that’s the thing about work and passion and life. As long as I believe that this system of writing works, I don’t have to worry anymore. 

#### Psychological Breaks

I wrote to a bunch of strangers what I fear about by doing this nine week program, in another city, already have spent so much money, and knowing none of these people. I get this email late Sunday or early Monday-ish where one of the students describes his fear about the program and what they think they can't accomplish. For the next few hours, I'm flooded with more email along the same lines. Paraphrasing, they're saying they're fearful that they can't keep up, that they are worried they won't get a job after the program, that they won't be able to understand the material, that they are afraid of quitting their jobs for the great unknown. And it dawns on me that we are all fearful, that we are all capable of feeling fear and that we seem to have very similar fears.

I have these similar fears, and I don't know how to really deal with them. I have this vague idea that I can fix it myself. During the second half of this assignment, after a few days to let everyone write about their fears, you have to respond to one of them with the voice of a good friend of theirs to help them alleviate their worries. As a group activity, this is powerful in so many ways, especially since we haven't met as a group yet, so I'm actually less afraid to speak my mind. I've mentioned before the shit sandwich where you tell someone a mean thing about that person in a really bad way, but layer it with two good things about them to make them feel better. Or the whole passive-aggressive thing in dealing with someone's issues. 

I'm not saying this will solve the world's problems, but this is a good activity in making aware that you have fears and they can be addressed, and perhaps lifting from you, if you allow others to talk back to you. This is starting to make less sense, so let's inject more alcohol in my system. Pauses. Ah, much better. Okay, where was I? Oh right, fears. I have a more mindful awareness when I have a fear, so I'll identify it and see if I can let it pass, or else I'll tell someone about it and see if they can help me let it go. It's a form of the inner game, and it's actually fun when you realize you have some control over your emotions.

I backed David Lang's book called "Zero to Maker"* on Kickstater and in the last update he had for the project, he included an omission to his book that he thinks should be added. The title of the post is called "[The Audacity of Learning](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1818704744/zero-to-maker-a-re-skilling-guide-for-new-makers/posts/751387?at=BAh7CDoMcG9zdF9pZGkDG3cLSSIIdWlkBjoGRVRpAvzrSSILZXhwaXJ5BjsGVEkiGDIwMTQtMDMtMTggMDE6MTE6NDYGOwZU--aaaed9c34a40b4576b15b306be39aeb1aee46a35&ref=backer_project_update)" which talks about his experiences of dealing with the struggles of learning new skills.

>I quickly moved through the parts of my story that were hard - the depression, the doubting, the insecurity - because I didn't wish that for anyone else. Probably more honestly, though, I just didn't know how to talk about those moments. I still don't. They're intensely personal. And embarrassing. I know that people are facing far bigger issues and challenges: illness, grief, loss. Those are real problems. Worrying about my lack of creative ability hardly seemed like reason to complain. But the truth is I've spent a good majority of the past few years feeling like an abject failure - entire days feeling as though I don't know enough, am not smart or skilled enough, and am just an overall drain on the world. In other words: just terrible.

#### The Inner Game: Different Kind of Mind Games

The power for us to shut off that side of the brain, or at least over-burden it with other activities, brings on something W. Timothy Galloway calls “Inner Game” as mentioned in his book “The Inner Game of  Tennis.” I highly recommend the book because of its practical value, but it really takes on this idea of performance of internal and external minds very seriously in his tennis coaching. Basically, this inner game is trying to turn off the left brain activities, mainly the part that judges everything you do in whatever sport or other activity, and play a more effective game by that feeling portion of your mind, or right brain. He doesn’t get into specific left vs. right thought pattern like Mrs. Edwards does, but it’s quite evident when you see the same pattern going on here. Mental performance hence is a game we play within ourselves. 

The inner game <sup>[1][1]</sup> is the mental game played between your ego and the rest of yourself. It's correlated to the two modes of thinking <sup>[2][2]</sup>, l-mode and r-mode <sup>[3][3]</sup>, left and right brained <sup>[4][4]</sup>, etc. This term is used for sports, music, and dating, though you can apply it almost anywhere. You may have peak performance in a game of tennis, for example, but when actually put to the test, under the spotlight of an actual match in a tournament, the mind can psych you out. That's the inner game.

But why is this important to anything else besides those three things listed above? Because we play this game everyday, nearly every hour. In the book "Games People Play" by Eric Berne from the 1960's <sup>[5][5]</sup>, the author lists several mind games that people play with themselves that really resemble the inner game battle. Diana has told me that she's run "all the simulations in her mind" about every conceivable possibility of what could happen if a certain action was taken (in science, we call this stimuli and response). I've tried to do this before, but realized there's no way of seeing the whole picture for me by just one action (e.g. in chess, you don't win by thinking the battle moves of your opponent in 10 turns as that would be too much computation. More intuition is involved).

I'm reading the book "Pragmatic Thinking & Learning," which tries to help you get in better mindsets and problem solving modes. One of the thing they discuss is how to enable one to get themselves engaged in r-mode thinking, and then transferring over to l-mode. R-mode thinking is associated with random, intuitive, holistic, synthesizing, subjective, and looks at wholes (gestalt). L-mode thinking, that little voice in your head, is logical, sequential, rational, analytical, objective, and looks at parts. <sup>[6][6]</sup> The shortcoming of R-mode is that you can't verbalize or put into words the action you are thinking about. For example, dreams are heavily associated with r-mode since it's the slow running process going on in the background. Also, if you've ever tried to figure someone's name, or the name of a song, and couldn't at the moment, but later on figure out what it is, like in the shower or while you're driving, that's r-mode thinking going on in the background. Transferring that to L-mode is important because it gives you a way to communicate these ideas to others and helps you figure out to your consciousness what's going on. 

Inner games can be dealt with in this manner, by stopping that l-mode thinking and allowing r-mode to kick in. In a game of tennis, you could be playing an opponent you may think is stronger than you, and you play accordingly. Psychologists would say there's the unconscious that wants you to throw the game so you can believe that little lie in your head that this opponent is better than you. It's the reason confidence and belief is so much stronger than just telling someone a lesson. I think everyone can use some of these exercises for unlocking your r-mode to help with many problem solving tasks.

#### Coping Mechanisms

#### Mindset (fixed vs. growth)

> Mindset is a simple idea discovered by world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck in decades of research on achievement and success—a simple idea that makes all the difference.

> In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success—without effort. They’re wrong.

> In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. Virtually all great people have had these qualities.

##### Effects of Shame

##### Payoffs of Resiliance

>> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.…" 
>> — Theodore Roosevelt

> In the nine months that it took me to shape and prune a dozen years of research into this book, I’ve revisited this quote at least one hundred times. And truthfully, I normally come back to it in fits of rage or with tearstained desperation, thinking, Maybe this is all bullshit, or It’s not worth the vulnerability. Just recently, after enduring a few really mean-spirited anonymous comments from a news website, I pulled the quote down from the pinboard over my desk and spoke directly to the sheet of paper, “If the critic doesn’t count, then why does this hurt so much?”

> As I held the quote in my hand, I remembered a conversation that I had just had with a guy in his very early twenties. He told me that his parents sent him links to my TED talks and he really liked the idea of Wholeheartedness and daring greatly. When he told me that the talks inspired him to tell the young woman he’s been dating for several months that he loved her, I winced and hoped for a happy ending to the story. 

> No such luck. She told him that she thought he was “awesome” but that she thought they should date other people. When he got back to his apartment after talking to his girlfriend, he told his two roommates what had happened. He said, “They were both hunched over their laptops and without looking up one of them was like ‘What were you thinking, man?’” One of his roommates told him that girls only like guys who are running the other way. 

> He looked at me and said, “I felt pretty stupid at first. For a second I was mad at myself and even a little pissed at you. But then I thought about it and I remembered why I did it. I told my roommates, ‘I was daring greatly, dude.’” He smiled when he told me, “They stopped typing, looked at me, nodded their heads, and said, ‘Oh. Right on, dude.’” 

> Daring greatly is not about winning or losing. It’s about courage. In a world where scarcity and shame dominate and feeling afraid has become second nature, vulnerability is subversive. Uncomfortable. It’s even a little dangerous at times. And, without question, putting ourselves out there means there’s a far greater risk of feeling hurt. But as I look back on my own life and what Daring Greatly has meant to me, I can honestly say that nothing is as uncomfortable, dangerous, and hurtful as believing that I’m standing on the outside of my life looking in and wondering what it would be like if I had the courage to show up and let myself be seen.

> So, Mr. Roosevelt… I think you nailed it. There really is “no effort without error and shortcoming” and there really is no triumph without vulnerability. Now when I read that quote, even when I’m feeling kicked around, all I can think is, Right on, dude.

### Memorization

#### What is memory?

![Memory Process](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9QR1MY530xA/S9rIfErB_AI/AAAAAAAAAFA/kcpHuOxpI9k/s400/memory_process.PNG)

You can break down the process of sensory input and memory in this linear fashion: sensory input -> sensory memory -> short-term memory -> long-term memory. The image below describes in verbs what's going on. The last box, retrieval, talks about how we bring back up a memory.

#### Working Memory

With encoding, we're looking at the things that we've decided to turn into a memory. This has a high importance because this will determine if we retain information or not. If we don't encode it correctly, we will screw our efforts in learning something. This encoding method is constrained by working memory, which is 7 +/- 2 chunks. This means in our attention span, we're only going to be juggling only this many chunks at a time. We can think of our attention span as RAM. Chunks here does not mean 7 characters and can take many forms that we can manipulate. For example, one chunk can be a phone number, it can be a word or a phrase, it can be a pneumonic. 

#### Spaced Effects

With working memory as our constraint, we consider this a drawback from learning faster. This means we're not going to process more information without properly going through the rest of the memory process beforehand. However, methodology is important here about how to space each session of this working memory. For example, each chunk of information can be mixed and combined with each other using association and serial position effects. Association with existing knowledge in your long term memory could save you time in remembering something, which is important when learning concepts and ideas, especially something that begins abstract. For example, remembering someone's name is difficult because you haven't placed it further that your sensory memory. A name is difficult to recall after the first meeting because it's an abstract construct in our mind. If you try to associate it with another friend who has the same name, it will be easier since that name is already encoded in your mind. You don't have to necessarily associate it with another person either; it can be an inanimate object or a koan. Serial position effects will allow you to group things in the order you received the information. For example, you'll have a better time remember the items of a list in the first and last positions than the middle. If the list items are closely related to each other in the beginning and the end, you'll have an easier time associating these words and merging chunks together. There's other effects you can try to pull with lists as well, like the Von Restorff Effect in which you place a unique signifier in the middle of the list, like a curse word or something that doesn't sound right. 

There's a time constraint with encoding, which is about a minute, before you forget this information. That's why proper spacing in terms of attention span and new information is critical. The best methods out there for this is the Anki method, which uses this data of how often we'll forget something and make you recall it afterwards. This is best for things you can put on flash cards because you can recall them anytime after using a timer. Many applications are built around this method. My personal favorite is Memrise on Android that really helps with language learning vocabulary. Other ways of approaching the time constraint is utilizing breaks, which is why coding marathons are not as effective as someone taking breaks in between coding sessions because of fatigue and attention span. What really utilizes this well is the Pomodoro Technique, which introduces breaks in your sessions of work properly.

Not everything is a flash card though. Sometimes the abstract needs remembering, and flip side answers in flash cards just won't do. This is when you take different approaches, like R-mode first followed by a switch to L-mode activity. I mention R-mode here, but this does not mean right brain. If you split the brain in two different processes, there's L-mode and R-mode and has been given other names by other scientists in different fields. For example, Daniel Kahneman thinks these as system 1 and system 2. I won't go in heavy discussion about this because there's a letter I wrote over a year ago explaining this in full detail. Now that we have that down, this activity that you do pairing each process with an activity is important. One activity is something I'm currently doing with you, which is recalling all of this information and trying to teach it to you. Other ways include doing the operations if your learning something that involves motor skills (e.g. just climbing before you get climbing lessons from an instructor), using metaphors to describe what you learned (really neat way of pairing two things that don't seem to mesh well, pair programming, and a general exposure to a foreign language spoken to you in a dark room (see Lozanov Seance).

The conditions in which we learn is also critical. Your well-being can influence the efficiency on how you learn. This is heavily tied with the amount of rest you receive each night (duration and the number of REM cycles are really important here) and physical and emotional fatigue. 

Then we arrive at storage. Our brain is not an efficient storage system, so we'll issue lags in memory for certain things we think are easy to recall, like birthdates, names, that title of the song you heard earlier. Your R-mode side of your brain will run this tasks with your unconscious riffling through each thing until it finds what it's looking for. This is the effect experienced when your in the shower and you finally figured out the name of that song you heard. 

One way memory athletes have approached this issue is by the Method of Loci, also known as memory palaces. This is where you take a familiar room or space in your mind and fill it with things to remember by using unique signifying objects. This technique is really powerful and can help you remember a deck of cards (which is correlated with counting cards in a casino) and in general skill acquisition operations. You have to go back a step and re-encode your memories, but having this visual memory palace could remain as one chunk and you'll be able to recall things a lot easier in a class (using the programming analogy here). 

Lastly is retrieval. I've talked extensively about skill acquisition, heuristics, and snap judgments before. As aforementioned, there are two ways of approaching retrieval, which is the slow process and fast process. The fast process are heuristics, or snap judgments. The slow process takes longer and you start to stretch your mind looking for more credible answers. Fast processes are stimulated by the external inputs, which can lead to some nasty outcomes (Read: Blink by Malcolm Gladwell). What's important here is that if you slow down that reactive side of thinking, you'll be able to think more clearly about certain decision points in the learning curve a lot better. And yes, go back to the letter about learning curves if you want to hear me talk more about that as well.

How much can you cram in one day? This depends on your method of cramming. For myself, I'm working on taking breaks and using other methods to properly encode it in my brain.

## Two Brains Concept (L and R-mode)

After reading most of the book, “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,” by Betty Edwards, I’ve changed my opinion about drawing completely. It is a skill that can be learned and honed. In fact, the natural ability to draw is just an untrue statement as one must actually work at it. The saying that, “Oh, if I just practiced at it as much as that person, I’d be that good too,” is this lazy saying that that person lacks the ability to draw because he or she wouldn’t even try and attempt it. The reason we lie to ourselves and don’t attempt to be the best painter we can be is that judgmental side of our brain, the left side. It judges as well as does a lot of other important functions. This duality of the mind where one side judges and the other side seems more simplistic is drawn from thousands of years of observations when you hear people talk about minds being yin and yang, or rational vs. intuitive, or abstract vs. concrete. The bottom line here is that we seem to have these two brains that battle against one another. Most of the time it is that seemingly logical side of the brain, or the left side, that is dominant. And from the book, “Thinking: Fast and Slow” by Daniel Kahneman, this dominant portion of the mind can be quite lazy at decision making and led to irrational behavior (specifics here would be a whole new letter). When we don’t let this side of us take over our activities, whether it be sports or drawing, we start noticing something different. 

### Explanation of L-Mode

### Explanation of R-Mode

#### How to engage it

Zen is this practice of turning off the mind, essentially that left side, and really honing in on the sensual feeling of the body and the soul, as mentioned by the Zen master dogan Shunryu Suzuki in his teachings at Zen Center in San Francisco. The description of finding that enlightenment is this feeling of ecstasy and happiness. This sensation goes by many names, and it is a place where time seems to pass without the user noticing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls it by the title of his book, “Flow.” It’s an optimal experience that comes out during the peak of one’s mental performance. Think about any time in which you were playing a sport or drawing a piece of art or writing a long essay or novel at your best. During that time, it just seemed as if there was no time, and the objective wasn’t about winning a game or making sure something looks as realistic. In fact, it really just didn’t matter at all. That is the Zen part of mental performance, because at its peak, it’s one of the same.

I didn’t just give you the formula to happiness though. There’s more to it than that, and it’s often a struggle trying to get to that stage. Of course, when that sensation does come, the happiness isn’t just some happiness of watching an episode of Portlandia because that program offers momentary happiness. This happiness is retained throughout the point before your other mind enters the picture again. Songs may have this effect on us too as we’re listening to something we cherish, but the moment it’s over, we tend to fall back to “reality.” (note: if shuffle is playing and won’t stop, that happiness may stay for a very long time as well) When reading the book, “The Power of Now,” I realized that was exactly what the author was trying to allure folks to. It wasn’t this new age thinking that just came over this person, but actually the teachings of hundreds if not thousands before him. Of course, there are places I can divert your attention to if you seek this type of place. There’s the “Power of Now” as mentioned before, but also “The Miracle of Mindfulness,” by Thich Nhat Hanh and “Zen Minds, Beginner Minds,” by Shunryu Suzuki. If you need to figure out how to get there through drawing, I recommended above the book “Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain,” by Betty Edwards. If you want it through sports, there is “The Inner Game of Tennis” by W. Timothy Galloway. He also has another book out specifically for music co-written with Barry Green called “The Inner Game of Music.” There’s also the best guide for writing a book and getting through writer’s block, which is another left brain nagging, called “Bird by Bird,” by Anne Lamott. 

As you can see, I’ve been developing this thesis off of other’s works for months, if not my entire college life. This thought that I have to figure out how to be the best, or at least find the road that will lead me to happiness is to inflect and look within myself. And when I took the advice of other people, I realized that it’s never just something you do one time, but probably every day and every moment that you consciously live. I’m currently reading “Mindset” by Carol Dweck, and it’s a fascinating read to find out what actually makes us perform better. To give a peak at what she says, people have fixed mindsets or growth mindsets in all areas. Those who excel have these growth mindsets. If you excel with a fixed mindset, it never really just stays there and you start making excuses when things don’t go your way. That struggle I talked of before is this shift of mindset, and one big major way is the main solution which is to shut off that left side that domineers with a judgmental voice.

The Action Plan

Another title for this could be "Getting Started." The hardest part about doing anything is executing the plan. It's easy to come up with the things you have to do to get there, but without initiative, planning, and execution, the next steps can be the hardest. That's why you hear sayings like it takes 50% of the effort to get 90% there, but another 50% of effort to reach the last 10%. 

One of the books that seems like a god-send to productivity gurus is the book "Getting Things Done," by David Allen. In this book, the author tells exactly how to get things done through stacking and filing the things you can do and delegating things you can't do to others. Let's say that you really want to impress some college recruiter out there, but you don't know how you can stand out from the crowd. Well, one approach I would use is the initial shotgun approach, where you try a lot of things that may interest you in the beginning. I knew I just really wanted to be part of the Model UN team, so I had that settled. For you, it may be to contact many organizations that help with LGBT issues, or some humanitarian effort, or perhaps just something you dabble in yourself, like marketing classes specifically catering to fashion. Now that you have a few concepts (the shotgun), you're ready to execute your ideas. First, write down a goal you want to achieve in this area. Say you want to do some fashion marketing. The goal I would choose is this: 

"My goal is to be able to market a line of jackets to middle aged women." 

There, it's not too hard. The next step is making your action step, or how you're going to get there. Most of the time, you know there's more than one step. That's why we call this an Action Plan. You create a schedule of what you expect to happen. In Engineering, or just product management in generally, we use software to help guide us called a Gnatt chart. Your schedule may look less sophisticated, like a calendar of events. After writing down some of the action steps, you realize this could go on for ages. That's why we create milestones, or what you hope to achieve by certain dates. These are the major steps to reaching your goal.

June 10th - Interview with local clothing stores about their marketing plan on selling new clothing items for older women. Follow-up interview with a formal plan of how you would go about helping their marketing.
June 17th - Have a concise marketing plan to sell this new line of clothing. Get feedback from others.
June 24th - But necessary supplies that will help execute your plan.

Each of these steps include a few more steps on where to go, how to do it. Remember, if you want someone to be impressed, document this. Start a blog about it. Or just keep it for your own records. Your learning valuable skills by just doing a project like this. For example, by showing a formal marketing plan, your practicing pitching. By creating a plan, you're learning a lot about project management and a little bit about executing marketing (which is basically advertising). By getting customer feedback, your learning customer relations with the retailer. If you need to, write all of this follow-up down as well as it helps formulate a good college resume and personal statement. 

Lastly, follow this action plan as best as you can. You make up all of the deadlines, all of the milestones you want to reach. Sometimes, your plan may seem to fail or your not reaching your milestones on time. Don't beat yourself up over this; you're actually learning what it takes to get things done, and there's some valuable lessons in that. The struggle is what lots of college recruiters want to hear about anyways, not about how you talked about doing it but did nothing to achieve it. 

And while going through this process, ask friends, maybe family, to read through your action plan. Or have an older mentor help you with it, especially if it's someone from the industry in which you hope to accomplish your work. People are more than willing to help others who do work in their field. It's harder when you don't have something concrete to say, just teach me something and I'll learn from you, because most people think that's just too exhaustive. Be specific about it, so don't just glaze through the topic you choose. And be passionate about doing this, because it'll show when you talk or write about this experience.

### Jerry Seinfeld's Productivity Secret

[Link to article from Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret)

> Years ago when Seinfeld was a new television show, Jerry Seinfeld was still a touring comic. At the time, I was hanging around clubs doing open mic nights and trying to learn the ropes. One night I was in the club where Seinfeld was working, and before he went on stage, I saw my chance. I had to ask Seinfeld if he had any tips for a young comic. What he told me was something that would benefit me a lifetime...

> He said the way to be a better comic was to create better jokes and the way to create better jokes was to write every day. But his advice was better than that. He had a gem of a leverage technique he used on himself and you can use it to motivate yourself—even when you don't feel like it.

> He revealed a unique calendar system he uses to pressure himself to write. Here's how it works.

> He told me to get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall. The next step was to get a big red magic marker.

> He said for each day that I do my task of writing, I get to put a big red X over that day. "After a few days you'll have a chain. Just keep at it and the chain will grow longer every day. You'll like seeing that chain, especially when you get a few weeks under your belt. Your only job next is to not break the chain."

> "Don't break the chain," he said again for emphasis.

> Over the years I've used his technique in many different areas. I've used it for exercise, to learn programming, to learn network administration, to build successful websites and build successful businesses.

> It works because it isn't the one-shot pushes that get us where we want to go, it is the consistent daily action that builds extraordinary outcomes. You may have heard "inch by inch anything's a cinch." Inch by inch does work if you can move an inch every day.

> Daily action builds habits. It gives you practice and will make you an expert in a short time. If you don't break the chain, you'll start to spot opportunities you otherwise wouldn't. Small improvements accumulate into large improvements rapidly because daily action provides "compounding interest."

> Skipping one day makes it easier to skip the next.

> I've often said I'd rather have someone who will take action—even if small—every day as opposed to someone who swings hard once or twice a week. Seinfeld understands that daily action yields greater benefits than sitting down and trying to knock out 1000 jokes in one day.

> Think for a moment about what action would make the most profound impact on your life if you worked it every day. That is the action I recommend you put on your Seinfeld calendar. Start today and earn your big red X. And from here on out...

> Don't break the chain!
