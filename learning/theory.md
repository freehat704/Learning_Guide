## On Beginning

Beginning something new can be terrifying. I have a whole portion of the psychological effects later on. Here's a spoken word speech on beginning:

> Don’t call it a comb-back; I’ll have hair for years.

> I’m scared.

> I’m scared that my abilities are gone.

> I’m scared that I’m going to fuck this up.

> And I’m scared of you.

> I don’t want to start, but I will.This is an invocation for anyone who hasn’t begun, who’s stuck in a terrible place between zero and one.

> Let me realize that my past failures at follow-through are no indication of my future performance.

> They’re just healthy little fires that are going to warm up my ass.

> If my FILDI (fuck it let’s do it) is strong let me keep him in a velvet box until I really, really need him.

> If my FILDI is weak let me feed him oranges and not let him gorge himself on ego and arrogance.Let me not hit up my Facebook like it’s a crack pipe

> Keep the browser closed.

> If I catch myself wearing a too-too (too fat, too late, too old) let me shake it off like a donkey would shake off something it doesn’t like.

> And when I get that feeling in my stomach — you know the feeling when all of a sudden you get a ball of energy and it shoots down into your legs and up into your arms and tells you to get up and stand up and go to the refrigerator and get a cheese sandwich — that’s my cheese monster talking.

> And my cheese monster will never be satisfied by cheddar, only the cheese of accomplishment.

> Let me think about the people who I care about the most, and how when they fail or disappoint me… I still love them, I still give them chances, and I still see the best in them.  

> Let me extend that generosity to myself.

> Let me find and use metaphors to help me understand the world around me and give me the strength to get rid of them when it’s apparent they no longer work.

> Let me thank the parts of me that I don’t understand or are outside of my rational control like my creativity and my courage.

> And let me remember that my courage is a wild dog.

> It won’t just come when I call it, I have to chase it down and hold on as tight as I can. Let me not be so vain to think that I’m the sole author of my victories and a victim of my defeats.

> Let me remember that the unintended meaning that people project onto what I do is neither my fault or something I can take credit for.

> Perfectionism may look good in his shiny shoes but he’s a little bit of an asshole and no one invites him to their pool parties.

> Let me remember that the impact of criticism is often not the intent of the critic, but when the intent is evil, that’s what the block button’s for.

> And when I eat my critique, let me be able to separate out the good advice from the bitter herbs.

> (There are few people who won’t be disarmed by a genuine smile

> A big impact on a few can be worth more than a small impact)

> Let me not think of my work only as a stepping stone to something else, and if it is, let me become fascinated with the shape of the stone.
> Let me take the idea that has gotten me this far and put it to bed.

> What I am about to do will not be that, but it will be something.There is no need to sharpen my pencils anymore.  
> My pencils are sharp enough.  

> Even the dull ones will make a mark.

> Warts and all.

> Let’s start this shit up.

> And God let me enjoy this.  Life isn’t just a sequence of waiting for things to be done.

And here's another quote with fewer words:

##### Information Overload
I've read way too much this year, and I haven't given it enough time to really sink in, so I know too many trivial points, not enough tangible topics to boost my skill set in anything. What's the phrase now, "jack of all trades, master of none?" But I think that's the point; I'm trying to expose myself to things that I would normally just put off or otherwise wouldn't pursue. I don't think I've spent enough time re-analyzing the underlying themes of the things that I'm exposed to, so it's time to take that step back and look around.

### The Science of Habits

#### Unlearning

As easy as it is to learn things, it's a lot harder to unlearn things. This can be the short, snap judgment responses we have when stimulated by a certain response, or an ingrained belief in something, like deep rooted hatred towards the trans* community. I'm just fascinated by this topic almost more than the topic on learning because it's the root of breaking addictions, how to stop falling in the same traps, figuring out how to stop working that inner game mindset, and so much more that we're burdened with everyday.

To make this letter different, I thought I would tell you a personal story instead. During college, one of the things I set a goal for myself was to be a better person and stop thinking like I used to think, especially those downward spirals of regret and misery. One of the things I thought I wouldn't fall trap to was feel worthless and do nothing for an entire day. The way I would combat this in college was to overload myself with work so I would never feel that way. But after burnout, there were times where I wanted to do that. And then the downward spiral hits where I feel worthless, desperate, and slightly insane.

It wasn't until later when I realized what bothered me more wasn't that I wasn't doing anything, but that I had this worthless talk inside of me. I had to recognize that this was happening and talk to it, or just let it happen. Then I would move on, unfazed by it and do some work or give myself permission to relax. There weren't specific instances where this changed, it was the multitudes of doing that same exercise every time that it happened that changed me. Your neuro-pathways remember a certain way of going through similar experiences after you've created those pathways in your mind. When I talked about "Your Brain on Porn" two years ago, I talked about how new neruo-pathways are created to fill that void in sexual response, and it's making people less sensitive to pornographic content as well as subjecting themselves to a rather crude belief of what sex is in our society. Also, it could lead to health issues later in life.

## Learning Difficulties

### Psychological

#### Psychological Breaks

I wrote to a bunch of strangers what I fear about by doing this nine week program, in another city, already have spent so much money, and knowing none of these people. I get this email late Sunday or early Monday-ish where one of the students describes his fear about the program and what they think they can't accomplish. For the next few hours, I'm flooded with more email along the same lines. Paraphrasing, they're saying they're fearful that they can't keep up, that they are worried they won't get a job after the program, that they won't be able to understand the material, that they are afraid of quitting their jobs for the great unknown. And it dawns on me that we are all fearful, that we are all capable of feeling fear and that we seem to have very similar fears.

I have these similar fears, and I don't know how to really deal with them. I have this vague idea that I can fix it myself. During the second half of this assignment, after a few days to let everyone write about their fears, you have to respond to one of them with the voice of a good friend of theirs to help them alleviate their worries. As a group activity, this is powerful in so many ways, especially since we haven't met as a group yet, so I'm actually less afraid to speak my mind. I've mentioned before the shit sandwich where you tell someone a mean thing about that person in a really bad way, but layer it with two good things about them to make them feel better. Or the whole passive-aggressive thing in dealing with someone's issues. 

I'm not saying this will solve the world's problems, but this is a good activity in making aware that you have fears and they can be addressed, and perhaps lifting from you, if you allow others to talk back to you. This is starting to make less sense, so let's inject more alcohol in my system. Pauses. Ah, much better. Okay, where was I? Oh right, fears. I have a more mindful awareness when I have a fear, so I'll identify it and see if I can let it pass, or else I'll tell someone about it and see if they can help me let it go. It's a form of the inner game, and it's actually fun when you realize you have some control over your emotions.

I backed David Lang's book called "Zero to Maker"* on Kickstater and in the last update he had for the project, he included an omission to his book that he thinks should be added. The title of the post is called "[The Audacity of Learning](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1818704744/zero-to-maker-a-re-skilling-guide-for-new-makers/posts/751387?at=BAh7CDoMcG9zdF9pZGkDG3cLSSIIdWlkBjoGRVRpAvzrSSILZXhwaXJ5BjsGVEkiGDIwMTQtMDMtMTggMDE6MTE6NDYGOwZU--aaaed9c34a40b4576b15b306be39aeb1aee46a35&ref=backer_project_update)" which talks about his experiences of dealing with the struggles of learning new skills.

>I quickly moved through the parts of my story that were hard - the depression, the doubting, the insecurity - because I didn't wish that for anyone else. Probably more honestly, though, I just didn't know how to talk about those moments. I still don't. They're intensely personal. And embarrassing. I know that people are facing far bigger issues and challenges: illness, grief, loss. Those are real problems. Worrying about my lack of creative ability hardly seemed like reason to complain. But the truth is I've spent a good majority of the past few years feeling like an abject failure - entire days feeling as though I don't know enough, am not smart or skilled enough, and am just an overall drain on the world. In other words: just terrible.

#### The Inner Game: Different Kind of Mind Games

Recall from two years ago that I was talking about the inner game. As a refresher, the inner game <sup>[1][1]</sup> is the mental game played between your ego and the rest of yourself. It's correlated to the two modes of thinking <sup>[2][2]</sup>, l-mode and r-mode <sup>[3][3]</sup>, left and right brained <sup>[4][4]</sup>, etc. This term is used for sports, music, and dating, though you can apply it almost anywhere. You may have peak performance in a game of tennis, for example, but when actually put to the test, under the spotlight of an actual match in a tournament, the mind can psych you out. That's the inner game.

But why is this important to anything else besides those three things listed above? Because we play this game everyday, nearly every hour. In the book "Games People Play" by Eric Berne from the 1960's <sup>[5][5]</sup>, the author lists several mind games that people play with themselves that really resemble the inner game battle. Diana has told me that she's run "all the simulations in her mind" about every conceivable possibility of what could happen if a certain action was taken (in science, we call this stimuli and response). I've tried to do this before, but realized there's no way of seeing the whole picture for me by just one action (e.g. in chess, you don't win by thinking the battle moves of your opponent in 10 turns as that would be too much computation. More intuition is involved).

I'm reading the book "Pragmatic Thinking & Learning," which tries to help you get in better mindsets and problem solving modes. One of the thing they discuss is how to enable one to get themselves engaged in r-mode thinking, and then transferring over to l-mode. R-mode thinking is associated with random, intuitive, holistic, synthesizing, subjective, and looks at wholes (gestalt). L-mode thinking, that little voice in your head, is logical, sequential, rational, analytical, objective, and looks at parts. <sup>[6][6]</sup> The shortcoming of R-mode is that you can't verbalize or put into words the action you are thinking about. For example, dreams are heavily associated with r-mode since it's the slow running process going on in the background. Also, if you've ever tried to figure someone's name, or the name of a song, and couldn't at the moment, but later on figure out what it is, like in the shower or while you're driving, that's r-mode thinking going on in the background. Transferring that to L-mode is important because it gives you a way to communicate these ideas to others and helps you figure out to your consciousness what's going on. 

Inner games can be dealt with in this manner, by stopping that l-mode thinking and allowing r-mode to kick in. In a game of tennis, you could be playing an opponent you may think is stronger than you, and you play accordingly. Psychologists would say there's the unconscious that wants you to throw the game so you can believe that little lie in your head that this opponent is better than you. It's the reason confidence and belief is so much stronger than just telling someone a lesson. <sup>[7][7]</sup> I think everyone can use some of these exercises for unlocking your r-mode to help with many problem solving tasks. I won't divulge on them in this email.

>> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.…" 
>> — Theodore Roosevelt

> In the nine months that it took me to shape and prune a dozen years of research into this book, I’ve revisited this quote at least one hundred times. And truthfully, I normally come back to it in fits of rage or with tearstained desperation, thinking, Maybe this is all bullshit, or It’s not worth the vulnerability. Just recently, after enduring a few really mean-spirited anonymous comments from a news website, I pulled the quote down from the pinboard over my desk and spoke directly to the sheet of paper, “If the critic doesn’t count, then why does this hurt so much?”

> As I held the quote in my hand, I remembered a conversation that I had just had with a guy in his very early twenties. He told me that his parents sent him links to my TED talks and he really liked the idea of Wholeheartedness and daring greatly. When he told me that the talks inspired him to tell the young woman he’s been dating for several months that he loved her, I winced and hoped for a happy ending to the story. 

> No such luck. She told him that she thought he was “awesome” but that she thought they should date other people. When he got back to his apartment after talking to his girlfriend, he told his two roommates what had happened. He said, “They were both hunched over their laptops and without looking up one of them was like ‘What were you thinking, man?’” One of his roommates told him that girls only like guys who are running the other way. 

> He looked at me and said, “I felt pretty stupid at first. For a second I was mad at myself and even a little pissed at you. But then I thought about it and I remembered why I did it. I told my roommates, ‘I was daring greatly, dude.’” He smiled when he told me, “They stopped typing, looked at me, nodded their heads, and said, ‘Oh. Right on, dude.’” 

> Daring greatly is not about winning or losing. It’s about courage. In a world where scarcity and shame dominate and feeling afraid has become second nature, vulnerability is subversive. Uncomfortable. It’s even a little dangerous at times. And, without question, putting ourselves out there means there’s a far greater risk of feeling hurt. But as I look back on my own life and what Daring Greatly has meant to me, I can honestly say that nothing is as uncomfortable, dangerous, and hurtful as believing that I’m standing on the outside of my life looking in and wondering what it would be like if I had the courage to show up and let myself be seen.

> So, Mr. Roosevelt… I think you nailed it. There really is “no effort without error and shortcoming” and there really is no triumph without vulnerability. Now when I read that quote, even when I’m feeling kicked around, all I can think is, Right on, dude.
