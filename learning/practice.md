Learning Practice
=================
[Back To Home](../README.md)

This will be the place I keep track of my projects that I'm currently learning. I've edited the format of my original readme to include things like markup language, unix commands, and git onto this page. It's a lot more applicable and will help me structure the way I teach learning. I'll have a few side cases as well that I don't think has enough content to be its own page. As I write more on that subject, however, I'll include more projects.

### Applications:

#### [Markdown Language](../markdown)
#### [Unix Commands](../unix)
#### [Git](../git)

## Writing

When I was in High School, I didn't think my writing skills could improve beyond what I learned in elementary school. I had written lots of essays, but none of my teachers were giving me good feedback in a timely manner. I thought I had the process down and didn't need to try and improve it. This resulted in a lot of failures in essay assignments because I tended to write more stream of conscious writing and didn't structure my words well. That was until my AP English teacher who taught me about [Aristotle's rhetorical triangle](http://www.public.asu.edu/~jvanasu/rhet-triangle.htm).

![Aristotle's Rhetorical Triange](http://thispublicaddress.com/tPA1/images/03_2002/t2.gif)

This triangle was the starting point in realizing the big questions of writing an essay.

* Who is my target audience?
* Why am I writing? or What is the purpose of writing this essay?
* What are the counter-points one could make about my argument?

Arguing without a purpose was pointless, and I had a better lens to frame what I was writing. Artistotle's triangle are ways to make an argument. 

Much later on in college, I was writing my own fiction novel. I was reading Anne Lamott's "Bird by Bird" which is in its own right a seminal work on how to write. I used that book to help me write the first few shitty drafts, which she encourages, because no matter how well you write, the first time's always going to be shit.

### Log of writing this guide

5/28/14

I'm a bit burnt out. I started this guide a few days ago and I'm not taking many breaks. Once I've cleared one of my to-dos, a lot more pop up. I started copying and pasting information that I've written as letters to friends and want to edit them, but I really just want the layout done right. The initial layout wasn't what I wanted, especially the index page. I've finished up the preliminaries with all of the pages, although I'm starting to realize that I need to structure this a big better. After I learned of creating checklists and tabbing my to-do list, I went off and wrote up everything I wanted to include. After that, the list exploded and I really want to cut the list down. I'll go back and re-do it so I can make it into actionable steps.

## Asking Quality Questions

One of the things that has fascinated me is how people ask such quality questions. It takes practice to interview someone and get to "real talk".

## How to Research

* Learn to use Google properly

[Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/) ran a series of blog posts from Daniel M. Russell challenging its readers to do advance searches via [Google](https://www.google.com/). His blog is called [SearchReSearch](http://searchresearch1.blogspot.com/) and his weekly challenges are still active.

## Language Learning

I've attempted many languages in the past.
