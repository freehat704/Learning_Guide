## On Beginning

Beginning something new can be terrifying. I have a whole portion of the psychological effects later on. Here's a spoken word speech on beginning:

> Don’t call it a comb-back; I’ll have hair for years.

> I’m scared.

> I’m scared that my abilities are gone.

> I’m scared that I’m going to fuck this up.

> And I’m scared of you.

> I don’t want to start, but I will.This is an invocation for anyone who hasn’t begun, who’s stuck in a terrible place between zero and one.

> Let me realize that my past failures at follow-through are no indication of my future performance.

> They’re just healthy little fires that are going to warm up my ass.

> If my FILDI (fuck it let’s do it) is strong let me keep him in a velvet box until I really, really need him.

> If my FILDI is weak let me feed him oranges and not let him gorge himself on ego and arrogance.Let me not hit up my Facebook like it’s a crack pipe

> Keep the browser closed.

> If I catch myself wearing a too-too (too fat, too late, too old) let me shake it off like a donkey would shake off something it doesn’t like.

> And when I get that feeling in my stomach — you know the feeling when all of a sudden you get a ball of energy and it shoots down into your legs and up into your arms and tells you to get up and stand up and go to the refrigerator and get a cheese sandwich — that’s my cheese monster talking.

> And my cheese monster will never be satisfied by cheddar, only the cheese of accomplishment.

> Let me think about the people who I care about the most, and how when they fail or disappoint me… I still love them, I still give them chances, and I still see the best in them.  

> Let me extend that generosity to myself.

> Let me find and use metaphors to help me understand the world around me and give me the strength to get rid of them when it’s apparent they no longer work.

> Let me thank the parts of me that I don’t understand or are outside of my rational control like my creativity and my courage.

> And let me remember that my courage is a wild dog.

> It won’t just come when I call it, I have to chase it down and hold on as tight as I can. Let me not be so vain to think that I’m the sole author of my victories and a victim of my defeats.

> Let me remember that the unintended meaning that people project onto what I do is neither my fault or something I can take credit for.

> Perfectionism may look good in his shiny shoes but he’s a little bit of an asshole and no one invites him to their pool parties.

> Let me remember that the impact of criticism is often not the intent of the critic, but when the intent is evil, that’s what the block button’s for.

> And when I eat my critique, let me be able to separate out the good advice from the bitter herbs.

> (There are few people who won’t be disarmed by a genuine smile

> A big impact on a few can be worth more than a small impact)

> Let me not think of my work only as a stepping stone to something else, and if it is, let me become fascinated with the shape of the stone.
> Let me take the idea that has gotten me this far and put it to bed.

> What I am about to do will not be that, but it will be something.There is no need to sharpen my pencils anymore.  
> My pencils are sharp enough.  

> Even the dull ones will make a mark.

> Warts and all.

> Let’s start this shit up.

> And God let me enjoy this.  Life isn’t just a sequence of waiting for things to be done.

And here's another quote with fewer words:

> Sucking at something is the first step to kinda not sucking at something
> - Jake the dog, "Adventure Time" tv show, Cartoon network, 2013

> Stop waiting for something to happen or for someone to give you permission to do things.

> - Kate Kendall (but probably attributed by Seth Godin)

## Beginner's Mind

> So I attempted learning the guitar when I was younger, and gave up on it. I was convinced that either my fingers were too chubby, or I wasn't nimble enough, or any number of other excuses that made it easy to give up.
> Several years later, what helped me succeed in learning this time:

> Accept the fact that, at first, you WILL suck. And you will continue to suck until you build up callouses. In fact, for the first several weeks of learning, you should be more concerned with sucking while building up callouses than you should be about perfecting your chords.

> I'm not sure if this sounds like herp-derp "of course" advice, or maybe even bad advice, but it has worked well for myself and a few beginners I've run into.

> The most obvious reason so many people give up on guitar is because "its hard," but I have found that many people don't seem to understand that it doesn't matter how fast you can memorize chords if your pudgy fingertips are smooshing over the strings and touching stuff they shouldn't.

> But yeah, I have one friend who is doing really well with the new outlook on practicing and another who almost gave up on guitar but can now do a few clean chords... all because instead of thinking they sucked at guitar, they realized that it was more of a physiological thing that you can't really shortcut, and if you stick in it long enough to earn your callouses, practicing becomes legitimately fun.

> So again, for all you beginners who got a guitar and a chordbook and are edging on giving up because "you can't do it." You can't -- yet. Keep practicing your chords, but switch your mindset from, "I can't play this chord clean yet," to, "I don't have enough callous yet."

> I'm one of the most ADD people imagineable, but I've gotten to the point where I enjoy playing a couple hours a day if I can... and its fun because I have earned my calluses.

> Edit: Just to add something that yakka2 mentioned... coming to terms with sucking is something that you'll need to get used to every time you try to up-the-ante and reach a new level of playing. I mean, a lot more comes into play like muscle memory and strumming styles -- but one constant remains the same: you will suck at first. But that's okay, even the best guitarists sucked before they didn't.

> tl;dr: You can either worry about embarrassing yourself and end up never learning a really awesome instrument, or you can do what many other people fail to do and keep working towards your goal long enough that your body catches up to your mind.
