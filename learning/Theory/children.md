## Children and Studying

### Intro to Child Development

### The Blank Mind

Steven Pinker has written a book on how much we know when we're born called "The Blank Slate". This gets us into the discussion on nature vs. nurture. In terms of learning, how much of ourselves is determined by our genetic make-up and how much of it is due to our own practice and doing (external stimuli)? It turns out that very little in skill is innate. For example, we may be more predisposed to throwing 3-pointers in basketball better because of our height, but it's not the only factor. It turns out almost all of our skills can be learned.

One way of looking at it is like this graph where first you are learning lots and lots, and then you reach what is referred here as a slump. We call this the initial growth "hypergrowth." During this period, you realize that you're learning as much as you can about the subject, for example learning Spanish. Initially, you learn a few words and phrases that you can piece together for a short conversation. However, when you get to longer conversations, you get stuck and try to use words that are unfamiliar to you are aren't practiced enough, as well as more complex ideas like the subjective tense. In these cases, you've reached a slump, and you realize that you're not fluent in the language, so your skill seems to diminish due to the effects of under-confidence bias. But slowly you're skill curve rises back up, and flattens out for a bit. This is called "the plateau" in which you try really hard to pound it in your brain, but as we understand from research, rote memorization can only work so quickly due to [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory)(a human limitation where the brain can only hold 7 +/- 2 chunks of information at any given time).

But don't be alarmed, there's an epiphany moment when you realize how it all fits. That's the feeling after weeks of practice paying off, and you reach a new understanding of the topic, like understanding when to use the subjective tense in Spanish and how to instantly conjugate the verb. However, there may be more of those moments of slumps where you're holes of knowledge slowly get filled in. And the process is always slow, as shown with the second slump in the graph. But you get it eventually. Finally, after all the problems with the process of learning, you reach a mastery at your skill or knowledge bank.

There's an eponymous law called [Pareto's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) that says that 80% of the output is created by 20% of the work. That's very true with skill acquisition where it seems easy the first 80% to 90% of the way, but to really acquire that last 10% of a skill, it takes upwards of 50%+ of the work to get there. A lot of that frustration seems to stem from not understanding something and still trying to pursue it. It's the anxiety feeling we get, and it falls out of our optimal point of working, which is called [flow](http://goo.gl/lbQ679). But sometimes, that's what it takes to really get there. The idea of doing something is always a lot easier to get done than the actual process of making that idea a reality.

Malcolm Gladwell points out in his book “Outliers” that while most people are successful for hard work and complimentary factors, people like more of the natural talent story. One’s ability to perform actions, whether mental or physical, is determined by so many environmental, or external, factors that aid or suppress it.
