A Guide to Learning
===================

[Back To Home](../README.md)

I've split up this section into three categories: learning theory, learning practice, and learning studies. Learning theory is the underlying theory behind how we learn. Learning practice is my own deep dives into learning something new. Learning studies is an analysis of case studies that exhibit forms of learning. In this, my goal is to help facilitate you into some stucture of learning that will help you achieve your goals.

As I begin to fill up these areas, I'll include a to-do list of all of the things that I'll still need to accomplish. This is not an overnight feat, and I'll generally try to update regularly.
