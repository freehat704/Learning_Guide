## Experiences From My Students

I'm a part time teachers now, and I get to watch my students try to learn. From this, I've included case studies of certain students of mine.

## Experiences From Tutoring

### From my peers

These are stories from students that I was in the same class in.

### From students in classes after me

I've done a fair amount of tutoring with students who are taking a class I took maybe semesters or years later. These are stories of those students.
