## Experiences From My Students

I'm a part time teachers now, and I get to watch my students try to learn. From this, I've included case studies of certain students of mine.

## Experiences From Tutoring

### From my peers

These are stories from students that I was in the same class in.

### From students in classes after me

I've done a fair amount of tutoring with students who are taking a class I took maybe semesters or years later. These are stories of those students.

### Addiction: Learning with Porn (From the series: [Your Brain on Porn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKDFsLi2oBk))

I want to talk about addiction. On July 2nd, 2012 I started looking into addiction even more. Gary Wilson has this excellent series on YouTube called “[Your Brain on Porn: six part series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKDFsLi2oBk)”. This series gives an introduction to the current science surrounding this recent phenomenon. The problem with this issue is that there are little to no studies directly linking internet porn to erectile dysfunction or other problems, but there can be much correlation drawn from other addictions such as drugs and food. Here’s a quick summary of that long series, which focuses primarily on males heterosexuals.

First, let’s note how this is a problem. There are a lot of stories found on the Internet that show a recurring problem from Internet Porn Addicts. First, Internet porn is not Playboy, or for that matter, magazine porn. You don’t just look at pictures of one centerfold; you watch many videos online of different porn stars going through intercourse, or other salacious actions. It’s more stimulating and can escalate rather quickly. Second, you don’t have to have an “addictive personality” to be hooked on Internet Porn. The overall picture of your brain is as follows: “you must survive” and “make babies.” These are survival instincts that are from the lifetime of hunter-gatherer societies and have not left us. 

Internet porn is unique in that unlike other addictions such as food or drugs; you can never be “full” from porn use. The bottom line is that porn is a “superstimulus.” It works like this: Internet porn allows the addict to watch more females involved in arousing activity, which stimulates your brain to want more. However, there is a diminishing effect after watching for too long, and the mind craves for something else, like another porn video, porn star or something more arousing activity such as “Brazilian Fart Porn” (reference to a “South Park” episode). This is called the Collidge Effect.

I’m going to go into the nitty gritty of addiction, which is helpful to point out why Internet porn can create addicts. Again, this isn’t quite a causal relationship, but there is such a high correlation with a lot of other activities, we can qualify it as an addiction. The limbic system is a portion of the brain that has more of our “primitive” aspects. Animals, especially mammalian, have this part of the brain while most animals don’t have the same size of our pre-frontal cortex, known more for higher-order thinking, i.e. rational thought. What the limbic system does is to govern emotions, such as fear, joy, anger, etc. What is so important about it in accordance with addiction is that it is the seat of most of our desires and drives, including hunger, mate selection and sexual urges.

If there’s something to really take away from this part of the brain, it is that sexual desire starts here and not the genitals. This is the region that tells you you’re horny. Because it’s quite basic in function, it seems to be all about “avoiding pain” and “repeating pleasure,” therefore it will be more binary in thought, such as “hot stove is bad,” or “Bali’s yogurt is good.” And the big centerpiece of the limbic system is the reward circuit. This is where you experience all desire and more pleasure, such as sex and orgasm. The way it works is that to get motivated to go through with some decision, you have to register a “reward” in your brain, e.g. doing well on this exam will give you the feeling that you are doing well in the class. The circuit is where addiction occurs. The more exciting the experience, the more this circuit is activation, which can get very bad with addiction. The main driver of this circuit is a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine is the driver for cravings, or wanting or something no matter what. Eventually, it leads you to the reward, whether it satiety from a meal or orgasm from sex. Normally the levels or dopamine follow a bell curve where it rises with motivation, desire and craving, and fall back down after you’re rewarded. It’s good to note here that orgasm isn’t experienced from dopamine, but rather opioids. Dopamine is the driver to an orgasm, but the feelings of an orgasm are from something else.

Let’s go back to the Coolidge Effect. What occurs is that dopamine surges and drops normally, but with viewing multiple porn videos, there are multiple surges and drops of dopamine that follow the shape of a sound wave.

In other words, the Collidge Effect keeps the addict surging with more dopamine, i.e. more cravings. Some people call dopamine the “molecule of addiction,” though through the lens of a Biochemist, it’s natural we have this molecule because it does help us with other urges and desires that’s necessary, like hunger. There is a baseline of dopamine that will allow us to function normally. Where the problem kicks in is too much of it, especially from drugs such as cocaine, alcohol, and nicotine. Internet porn addiction has the similar surge of dopamine, and that’s a problem.

Some of the behaviors of addicts will forget about eating, sleeping, sex, or taking care of children. Things start to become an addiction, according to the American Psychiatric Association, if there are 3 or more checks to a listed criterion that can be viewed on their website. Some of the criteria include tolerance, withdrawal, difficulty controlling use, and negative consequences. According to many stories, and myself included, I could say yes to some of the criteria when applied to porn addiction.

What about regular dopamine releasing activities? They are called “natural reinforcers.” They drive us towards food and sex. However, high stimulation versions of food and sex can get us hooked even if we aren’t genetically susceptible to addictions (only about 15% of drug users will ever really be addicted). A “natural reinforcer” can be addictive if they are highly stimulating than normal, it is in limitless supply, there are lots of varieties and we can binge on it without realizing it can cause brain changes. And guess what, porn definitely qualifies.

Now that we know Internet porn can be overstimulating, we can now talk about how the brain changes accordingly. The brain will numb its reward circuitry with this change and rewire brain circuits. The numbing occurs because you’ve messed up your dopamine response and so the brain has to act accordingly to feel less pleasure. However, this is a positive feedback loop in which there will be more craving and more desire to feel that reward, i.e. pleasure, yet the brain will continue to change so that it will not take in that much dopamine. This happens by reducing the amount of receptors in your synapse. Okay, now that I’ve scared you with the word synapse, let’s talk about nerves. Synapses are gaps between nerve cells for communication. Electricity runs down the nerve, but it will release chemicals such as dopamine at the synapse which will send the message to the next nerve cell. The chemicals do this by binding to the receptors of the next nerve which “hear” the message and report it back to the next neuron. Normally, the dopamine being released will drop after the reward is done. However, with addiction, the surge will continue and drive the circuit even more. It’s like adding more power to your appliances when they only need 60 watts. The brain will then reduce the number of receptors and make it harder for dopamine to bind to dopamine receptors. This causes weakened response from the dopamine surge, so naturally the dopamine levels should fall back to normal. Addiction doesn’t allow that due to those goddamn cravings. And that, folks, is the cycle of addiction, and why we even have addiction in the first place.

Here’s something really bad. Rats were given a normal diet for most of their life leading up to an experiment. Then they were fed as much as they wanted for two weeks. After that, they went back to a normal diet. Scientists found that these rats could hardly eat. It became too “boring.” Porn is like that too in that old porn can become “boring” or not stimulating enough and tastes in porn can change over time (again, see that South Park episode). Another thing the study found was that after two weeks back on the regular diet, the rat’s dopamine receptors did not increase back to normal levels. This could be genetic, though also be due to a binge mechanism. Having endless “mating” opportunities, to a screen, can be too good for your own damn good, and your brain can’t tell the difference. I can’t find a reasonable explanation for this one though, so I’m going to drop it here.

I still haven’t explained the rewiring, so let me get to that. Think as these circuit pathways as foot paths. When you first walk through a field of tall grass, it’s pretty heavy going. The more often you take that path, the easier it becomes. Eventually the path becomes just dirt, and you can think of that process similar to a memory or skill or habit. An addiction is when you use a weed whacker to clear a path to form a walk way. It’s your brain to keep certain circuits open because they are important, like Internet porn. These circuits can be created through emotions such as excitement, fear, shock, disgust, guilt or shame. That’s why it’s actually very harmful to feel guilty while watching porn or shame. It’s what some people refer to as a “guilty pleasure.” Addiction is a very powerful memory combined with a numbed please response. It is the “path of least resistance to relief” and can help those urges or cravings. Cues can helped this and lead to an altered state, which can be the sight of your favorite porn star, images, sensations, etc. These cues tell your limbic system to turn on that reward circuit, and away you go. Cues are so goddamn powerful; it will stop your pre-frontal cortex from questioning your actions. 

There can be recovery from addiction though. It will never be a full recovery because those circuits in the brain have been created and will never leave, with the exception of losing that part of your brain due to some trauma. However, as an addict, I can reboot and rewire myself by stopping myself from watching porn or masturbating. I’ve read way too many stories of erectile dysfunction including copulatory impotence, which I don’t want, so it’s time to stop that wanking. I hope my own journey through this process will make me better as I erase porn from my life, and hard drive, and never return to it again. I started masturbating at an older age than everybody else, and have been doing it since. As of this writing, I’ve stopped masturbating for 15 days now and feel a bit better, though I do realize I did have some withdrawal effects.

So why even write out about how addiction works? Well, it’s something that one of my professors at Cal Poly told me about learning, reinforced with psychological studies. Trying to teach someone else about a topic will help me understand what I just learned. It’s also cuts down time when you study for a test, which could be useful if I was still in school.
