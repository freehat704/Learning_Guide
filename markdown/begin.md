Markdown: Let's Begin
=====================

# Basics

## Paragraphs

Creating a new paragraph is relatively easy. All you have to do is just start writing on a new line.

Example:
```
You can write anything you want.

If you leave a blank space between the line, you will have a line break when you view the file. 
```

## Headings

Like in HTML, we have six headers we can use. Instead of ```h1``` through ```h6``` tags, we have # tags.

```
# Represents h1 (or largest header)
## Represents h2
and so on until ######, which represents h6.
```

## Blockquotes

## Styling Text

# Lists

### Relative Links

One of the cool things Github provides in their version of markdown is the use of [relative links](https://help.github.com/articles/relative-links-in-readmes). For example, I needed to include a button that goes back to the home page, so I added a link at the top that says "Back To Home". 

```
[Back To Home](../README.md)
```
