=====================

# Basics

## Paragraphs

```
You can write anything you want.

If you leave a blank space between the line, you will have a line break when you view the file.

### Relative Links

One of the cool things Github provides in their version of markdown is the use of [relative links](https://help.github.com/articles/relative-links-in-readmes). For example, I needed to include a button that goes back to the home page, so I added a link at the top that says "Back To Home". 

```
[Back To Home](../README.md)
```
