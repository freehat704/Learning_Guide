Markdown: Let's Begin
=====================

## Basics

### Paragraphs

Creating a new paragraph is relatively easy. All you have to do is just start writing on a new line.

Example:
```
You can write anything you want.

If you leave a blank space between the line, you will have a line break when you view the file. 
```

### Headings

Like in HTML, we have six headers we can use. Instead of ```h1``` through ```h6``` tags, we have # tags.

```
# Represents h1 (or largest header)
## Represents h2
...
###### Represents h6
```
# Represents h1
## Represents h2
### Represents h3
#### Represents h4
##### Represents h5
###### Represents h6

### Blockquotes

This can be indicated with a ```>``` symbol before starting your quote.
```
Maya Angelou once said the following:

> Courage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently. You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage.
```

### Styling Text

We can style our text to be *bold* or **italic**.
```
To add bold words, wrap your word(s) in "*" symbol, e.g. *bold text*
To add italics, wrap your word(s) in two "*" symbols, e.g. **italic text**
You may have italics with a bold phrase inside. No worries, use an underscore "_" to mean one or another. 
For example, **this phrase is in italics, _and this is in bold and italics_ to demostrate my point.**
```

## Lists

## Links

### Relative Links

One of the cool things Github provides in their version of markdown is the use of [relative links](https://help.github.com/articles/relative-links-in-readmes). For example, I needed to include a button that goes back to the home page, so I added a link at the top that says "Back To Home". 

```
[Back To Home](../README.md)
```
