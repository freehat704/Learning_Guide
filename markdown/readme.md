Markdown Guide

[Back To Home](../README.md)

The markdown language is used by Github and I want to utilize it in the form of a wiki for all of the things I learn about learning. One way to achieve this is to practice it with a goal you have for yourself. My goal is to be good working with the markdown language.

### History of the Markdown Language

Markdown is from ? (Research needed)
[Wikipedia Article on Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

### Markdown Language Applications

Github certainly uses markdown, but there are other websites that rely heavily on it as well. Wikipedia and affiliated Wikimedia websites use their version of the markdown language throughout their website (reference needed).

### Relative Links

One of the cool things Github provides in their version of markdown is the use of [relative links](https://help.github.com/articles/relative-links-in-readmes). For example, I needed to include a button that goes back to the home page, so I added a link at the top that says "Back To Home".
