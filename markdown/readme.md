The markup language used by Github is called markdown. Markdown is a language that is easy to read and easy to write text format that outputs into valid HTML. I want to utilize it in the form of a wiki for all of the things I learn about learning. One way to achieve this is to practice it with a goal you have for yourself. My goal is to be good working with markdown.

### History of Markdown

Markdown was created by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) with significant contributions from [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/) <sup>[2](#2)</sup> back in 2004. Here is the original introduction from Gruber.

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

> Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. <sup>[1](#1)</sup>

Since the release of Markdown, Gruber hasn't done much updates with it. <sup>[3](#3)</sup> 

From this initial write-up, different websites have adopted this format with their own variants. This includes [Github](https://github.com/), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/), and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), just to name a few. Another application that has risen is Multimarkdown, <sup>[4](#4)</sup> which is created by [Fletcher Penny](http://fletcherpenney.net/) that adds more syntax to markdown and has support for extensions.

## Getting Started

### Text Editors

The first thing to do is to install a text editor. MS Word is not a good text editor. Here's a list of suggestions:

* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
* [Textmate](http://macromates.com/)
* [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)

Personally, I'm using Sublime Text 2 since I'm also learning programming. It's really a matter of preference here, and browser support, so choose one and let's continue to the next section.

### Git and Github

I'm not going to go much in detail about [git](http://git-scm.com/) because I talk about it in the [Git section](../git) of the learning project, and there are [some great write-ups](http://skillcrush.com/2013/02/18/git/) out there for it. In short, git is a kind of version-control software that allows an individual or group to work on projects while saving every previous versions, branch from the master version, and a lot more. 

I'll be using git to commit changes to my write-ups and Github to share my project. Github uses its own version of markdown they call '[Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).' I'll be showing you the basics of it.
