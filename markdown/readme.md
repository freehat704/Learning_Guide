The markup language is markdown, which is used by Github. I want to utilize it in the form of a wiki for all of the things I learn about learning. One way to achieve this is to practice it with a goal you have for yourself. My goal is to be good working with markdown.

### History of Markdown

Markdown was created by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) with significant contributions from [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/) <sup>[2](#2)</sup> back in 2004. Here is the original introduction from Gruber.

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

> Thus, “Markdown” is two things: (1) a plain text formatting syntax; and (2) a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. <sup>[1](#1)</sup>

Since the release of Markdown, Gruber hasn't done much updates with it. <sup>[3](#3)</sup> 

From this initial write-up, different websites have adopted this format with their own variants. This includes [Github](https://github.com/), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/), and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), just to name a few. Another application that has risen is Multimarkdown, <sup>[4](#4)</sup> which is created by [Fletcher Penny](http://fletcherpenney.net/) that adds more syntax to markdown and has support for extensions.

## Getting Started



### Relative Links

One of the cool things Github provides in their version of markdown is the use of [relative links](https://help.github.com/articles/relative-links-in-readmes). For example, I needed to include a button that goes back to the home page, so I added a link at the top that says "Back To Home". 

```
